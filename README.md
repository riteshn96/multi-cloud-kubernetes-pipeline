# Multi-Cloud DevOps Pipeline for a Containerized Application

## 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for deploying a simple Python web application to two different cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. The entire infrastructure is managed as code using Terraform, and the pipeline is orchestrated by Jenkins.

The primary goal is to showcase a robust, automated, and multi-cloud deployment strategy, which is a common requirement in modern, resilient systems.

**Workflow:**
1.  A developer pushes code to the GitHub repository.
2.  A GitHub webhook triggers the Jenkins pipeline.
3.  Jenkins checks out the code, builds a Docker image, and pushes it to Docker Hub.
4.  The Jenkins pipeline connects to the target cloud (AWS or Azure).
5.  Terraform provisions the necessary infrastructure (VPC, Kubernetes Cluster).
6.  Jenkins deploys the application to the Kubernetes cluster using the manifest files.
7.  The application is accessible to the end-user via a public Load Balancer.

## 5. How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites

*   An AWS Account with Free Tier access
*   An Azure Account with a Free Subscription
*   A GitHub Account
*   A Docker Hub Account
*   All necessary CLIs and tools installed locally (Git, Docker, Terraform, AWS CLI, Azure CLI).

### Step-by-Step Instructions

*(This section is your detailed, step-by-step guide on how someone else could replicate your work. Be precise!)*

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-project-name.git
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2.  **Configure Cloud Credentials:**
    *   For AWS: Run `aws configure` and provide your access keys.
    *   For Azure: Run `az login` to authenticate.

3.  **Provision Infrastructure with Terraform:**
    *   Navigate to the `terraform/` directory.
    *   Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
    *   Apply the configuration for AWS: `terraform workspace select aws && terraform apply`
    *   Apply the configuration for Azure: `terraform workspace select azure && terraform apply`

4.  **Set up Jenkins:**
    *(Explain how to set up Jenkins, install plugins, and configure credentials for GitHub, AWS, Azure, and Docker Hub.)*

5.  **Run the Pipeline:**
    *   Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins pointing to the `Jenkinsfile` in this repository.
    *   Trigger the build. The pipeline will build the Docker image and deploy it to both AWS and Azure.

6.  **Verify the Deployment:**
    *(Explain how to get the Load Balancer IP from both Kubernetes clusters and access the application in a browser.)*

## 6. Key DevOps Best Practices Implemented

*(This section directly answers the "why" and shows you understand the theory behind the tools.)*

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** All cloud infrastructure is defined declaratively using Terraform. This ensures environments are repeatable, version-controlled, and auditable, eliminating manual configuration drift.
*   **Everything as Code:** The application code (`app.py`), its dependencies (`requirements.txt`), and the containerization recipe (`Dockerfile`) are all version-controlled in Git. This provides a single source of truth for the application. Not just infrastructure, but the CI/CD pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`) and application deployment (`kubernetes/*.yaml`) are also stored as code in the same repository.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** We don't modify running containers. Instead, we build a new Docker image for every code change and deploy it. This leads to stable and predictable systems.
*   **Multi-Stage Docker Builds:** ** The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build pattern. A `builder` stage is used to install dependencies, and the final image is built from a `slim` base, copying only the necessary application code and packages. This best practice significantly reduces the final image size, which improves security (smaller attack surface) and performance (faster downloads/deploys).
*   **Secrets Management:** Jenkins credentials store all sensitive keys (AWS, Azure, Docker Hub). No secrets are hardcoded in the repository.
*   **Multi-Cloud Strategy:** Deploying to both AWS and Azure demonstrates a strategy for high availability and avoiding vendor lock-in.

## 7. Cleanup

To avoid incurring cloud costs, remember to destroy all infrastructure after you are finished.

```bash
cd terraform/
terraform workspace select aws && terraform destroy
terraform workspace select azure && terraform destroy
